      <div class="apphub_CardTextContent">I’ve heard a lot about The Banner Saga, but, due to my laziness, I never really checked out their kickstarter page to see what all the fuss was about.  However, I was lucky to get myself a review code from the publishers and I have to say that it wasn’t anything I expected.  I feel like I’m playing the Oregon Trail, but with Vikings, which would make my nine year old self jealous.<br><br>In a world where the sun no longer shines and the Gods have all become deceased; there are only humans,  varl and the dredge.  Humans were the original creatures who were clever, varl are a cross-breed between man and animal being quite large with horns and dredge are large armored enemies that are quite mysterious.  A new war is breeding with the dredge now attacking the other two races leaving them to flee from all they know and out into the wild.  The humans and varl are now trying to reduce the threat while not trying to kill each other.<br><br>I can say that the story is unique, even if it started off a bit slow.   While there is the main plot with the dredge running everything over there are many sub plots going on at the same time.  The main plot doesn’t really change. The sub plots, however, all depend on the choices you make.  These actions can affect the first few minutes, and it can make everything exciting.  You have no idea who will betray you or when someone will die, and nothing really ever goes right.<br>My one main issue with the story is if there will be a second one.  There are many questions to be asked and no real answers were given at the end.  If the saga does indeed continue then this isn’t a problem, but if they decide to end it right here the ending leaves you feeling lost.<br><br>The battle system is turn based where one player goes and the other one follows, just like chess.  When one side is down to one fighter it goes into a pillage mode where the opposing team only gets one turn until the other team is done with the remaining players.  Renown is gained from killing players which later can be used to upgrade characters, buy supplies or new charms.  <br><br>While fighting, your character can either try to do physical damage to the enemy’s armor or attack their strength.  Your strength also counts as your health which means the more you have the more damage is done and the less is the opposite.  Each character has a special ability that can be used using their willpower.  They can hit the armor, strength or even both and can be used to help allies.  Altogether there is a lot of strategy to be done with this and it is quite distinctive and varies from other roles playing games.<br><br>After a battle is done you have the option to camp or stop in town to either train, rest or shop around.  Between towns you will have a caravan full of warriors or clansmen you need to take care of.  Keeping a full stock of supplies is needed so they don’t go hungry and you may run into people to help or they could be bandits who will try to steal from you.<br><br>When upgrading your characters with the renown you collect after battles there are a few options to go through.  After killing a certain number of opponents you are given the option of increasing your ability to a new rank, armor for blocking damage, strength for damage and heath, willpower to hit harder or perform an ability, exertion for how much willpower you can carry, and break which is the amount of direct damage you can naturally do to an enemy’s armor.<br><br>The graphics would have to be the first thing I noticed right away.  It is a 2D art style where I feel like I’m watching an old cartoon show on a Saturday morning.  I have to say the first hour of everything almost made me forget I was playing a game.  The majority of the game is done through text with little to no movement from the characters while they are talking.  I was hoping for more voice work, but sadly I was wrong.  I know I shouldn’t be complaining and letting my imagination do the work, but it felt like a missing piece with its grand entrance.<br><br>Overall I enjoyed this more than I thought I would.  This was well done in graphics and story for an indie game, but the battle system is what really brings you in.  As I said it can be a little hard to get used to at the start, but once the training wheels are off be ready to face not only challenging enemies on the field, but also hard decisions.  I would say an eight of ten is the right score for this game because while it does have many unique qualities to it, it isn’t perfect either.<br><br><a class="bb_link" href="http://youtu.be/lkf1Z2AqtHo" target="_blank"  id="dynamiclink_0" onclick="return AlertNonSteamSite( this );">http://youtu.be/lkf1Z2AqtHo</a></div>

      <div class="apphub_CardTextContent">An exciting game. Very enjoyable, given that you know what to expect.<br><br>Gameplay: First thing to note - this isn't a traditional CRPG at all. No open world, no exploring, no looting random enemies etc. etc. Basically, the game consists of story given in textual form plus tactical battles. Surprisingly enough, this game is actually very much like a Japanese visual novel: making choices in dialogues with some fighting in between. Nothing wrong with that, but I guess there are people who dislike that kind of stuff.<br>Combat system: The game has an original turn-based combat system which can be a bit confusing in the beginning, but is, in fact, very consistent and coherent. Fights are interesting and challenging - this game isn't easy at all at Normal difficulty (though it isn't exactly hard, the balance is just right). So that part of the game is very well-executed.<br>Graphics: The artwork in the game is to die for! For me at least it was love at first sight. I actually find it quite difficult to stop pressing F12 all the time. Every single screenshot is a piece of art!<br>Music: Good, adequate, though I'm not exactly willing to listen to that soundtrack when not in game. Which isn't a bad thing, there aren't that many game soundtracks that can stand on their own.<br>Story: I'm not quite finished with it so it's a bit early to say, but so far - not bad at all. And I would definitely play again to see what different choices can lead to. All is well here. If it wasn't for one thing... which is in fact the only thing I didn't exactly like about the game -&gt;<br>Writing: This is the only thing I find somehow... lacking. Don't get me wrong, I like the plot, I like the characters. I don't like writing itself, because it lacks style, it lacks flavor. It wouldn't be such a big deal if this game wasn't at least 50% textual. I'm not saying that all the characters have to speak like they are in the poetic Edda, but all those &quot;ok&quot;, &quot;crap&quot;, &quot;yeah&quot; and &quot;everything was a mess&quot;-sort of descriptions are not to my liking. And there are typos too. As a part of the game, it's not crucial, because there's also artwork and music and other things. But had this been a book... I'd probably deem it a poorly-written one.</div>

      <div class="apphub_CardTextContent">It's nice when you are rewarded for making good decisions. This happened to me, not in-game, but after playing nearly 7 hours straight of The Banner Saga, the first game I backed on Kickstarter that has given me every penny's worth and <b>MORE</b>. It's a rare blend of Game of Thrones, Disney flicks of yore and &quot;Choose your own adventure&quot; that will engulf you in it's rich history and keep you on the edge while watching 2D caravans march through the land.<br><br>Don't buy DayZ or Rust.<br><br>Give the good people of Stoic your money instead, they also need to be rewarded for making good decisions.</div>

      <div class="apphub_CardTextContent">I've put a couple hours in with TBS now, and I'm pleased. The game is beautiful, feels like playing an adult version of a Disney film, but you can tell that from the screenshots. It has a very interesting combat system, although it may be a bit tough if you aren't familiar with tactical rpg's. It reminds me a bit of Vandal Hearts if anyone remembers that game. <br><br>The character progression system is also interesting, though it could be a little more explicit on things like what each stat really does. So far the story is compelling, and I do look forward to seeing it through, and possibly playing it multiple times to see what my choices may change. If you were a fan of Final Fantasy Tactics or anything of the like, pick this up, it's a good price and I think you will enjoy it.</div>

      <div class="apphub_CardTextContent">OMG... this game pretty much has it all. Beautifull graphics, perfect sound and score. It makes you think in the battles. Devs you did an outstanding job in fact very few game have acheived this high of level in gaming. The only other game that had perfect music with graphics with gamplay was Skyrim. You guys for first timers are just outstanding. Only one problem that I had and it wasn't even game breaking. Was when selecting you next place in the first city to goto. The words blended into the background to where they could bearly be seen. But over all you guys made a very impressive game. The drawings and attention to the details of the characters is what these big companies need to go back to and learn something from you guys. I did pre order the game and wasn't at all let down from it.</div>

      <div class="apphub_CardTextContent">I've been waiting for a game like this for a long time, banner saga offers a great singleplayer experience in a fantasy world on par with the elder scrolls and maybe even LOTR. The characters are each crafted as individuals with their own personalities and engaging backstories. The world itself has been crafted from the ground up with each river, road, forest and village having its own backstory as to why and what it is. I find the Banner Saga to be a refreshing game in the ever flowing torrent of ♥♥♥♥ releases we see in this day and age. 10/10 Would bang.</div>

      <div class="apphub_CardTextContent">I enjoyed the game quite a bit. To start off one playthough takes about 10 hours. <br><br>Since the game is fairly different than most games on the whole, I figured it'd be easier to point out the similarities it may have with some established games. The game's a little bit like: <br><br>Fire Emblem -  grid based combat, but individual unit turn-based with a strength as hp mechanic and armor -- you can try out The Banner Saga: Factions, the corresponding free multiplayer game to try the combat, <br><br>Oregon Trail - you travel along a fairly linear path making decisions as you go with a caravan nonetheless, <br><br>Dragon Age - unlike Fire Emblem series where if you lose a character in combat, you lose him/her in the campaign, in TBS you can only lose characters through decisions you make out of combat -- falling in combat will only injure a unit for the next fight, unless you rest at camp or have enough time pass to heal the injuries, <br><br>King of Dragon Pass - the decision system is similar and you will be given chances to wage war, however you only control the army by choosing one command, such as Charge, Formation, Defend, etc. which then prompts a regular combat scenario,<br><br>---<br><br>The campaign affects combat in several main ways. Probably most importantly, it affects who you will be able to play as in combat and which encounters will be combat encounters or bypassed through resolution or avoidance. You can add new characters to your party or even accidentally, or purposefully, kill off members of your team. <br><br>Next,  your caravan morale affects how much willpower your team has starting the match. Willpower allows characters to use their special abilities, deal extra armor break or damage, and to move further in a single turn. If your caravan morale is low, your team will start fights with less than normal willpower, but if they start with high morale, they will receive bonus morale. <br><br>Lastly, from making some decisions, you can gain reknown (the currency used to level up units and to buy equippment and supplies -- supplies are used to feed your whole caravan and maintain morale).<br><br>---<br><br>Strengths:<br>As you'll see stated in most any other review, TBS is a gorgeous game. The combat is equally good and quite strategic.<br><br>The vast and detailed world map shows the scope of the game's world in the classic Tolkien fashion.<br><br>The characters and decisions are very impactful. You can lose or gain key characters (and their equipment) based on your decisions. Some decisions will have immediate results, while others may show up long after you've made them. <br><br>Weakness:<br>The biggest issue I had with the game is that it felt lopsided on the decision system. If you made a series of a few bad decisions, you wound up always struggling to get supplies, and on the flipside, if you make a series of good decisions, you have a fairly easy time. This is because all of the systems seem to compound on eachother. I preferred to be struggling, because it kept the tension of survival prominent.<br><br>I enjoyed the overall structure of the story and the many decisions I had to make along the way, however the dialogue sometimes was poorly phrased, such as by using modern colloquial slurs. Some characters would use lore-based expressions, while others frequently sounded like they were from the current era. <br><br>This was an odd issue. Some character and city names I did not know how to pronounce, and so I didn't commit many characters and places to memory.<br><br>Lastly, you're always moving forward, from point A to point B. Once you leave camp or town you continue back on your journey. Instead of directly choosing your destination, you're sent in the general direction the story tells you to go, able to take detours or backtrack only when an event decision occurs.<br><br>---<br>On Combat:<br>If you are not familiar with The Banner Saga's combat, I could see it being a fairly difficult game, as common strategic thought is to kill off units rather than leave them maimed and on the board. With TBS's turn-based system, one character takes a turn then control passes to the opponent to move one character. The order of character movement is established before combat and can be changed only by a few special characters once in combat. Although it might seem odd at first, this system requires much more strategy than just going from one side of the board to the other wiping out all enemy units. Each time you kill off an enemy unit, you are giving the opponent an advantage, slight or large dependent on the difference between both sides' total units.<br><br>I find TBS's combat system to be a good addition to turn-based strategy family and prefer it to most other turn-based game systems.<br><br>What I'd like to have seen:<br>Skirmish mode - a mode to fight on all the different maps vs the AI using characters unlocked through the story-mode,<br><br>Characters &amp; Maps - story characters/classes added to The Banner Saga: Factions (the multiplayer version of the game);<br><br>Multiplayer - The Banner Saga: Factions accessible in-game from TBS's client; I think leaving the two games separate can cause some confusion for players, some may only know about one version and not the other;</div>

      <div class="apphub_CardTextContent">I have been truly excited for this release. I'm a veteran of The Banner Saga: Factions, the multiplayer aspect of this - which helped to develop the AI. I absolutely adore that game, so I had an idea of the combat coming into this. What I did not expect was the scale. I avoided most news up to this release, so as to be fresh and not have any expectations. The battles are wicked. You will not be coddled, one mistake can wreck you. You're always outnumbered. The battle system is fantastic. I adored every battle, minus the final one. That wrecked me, took 5 tries (on hard though).<br><br>The story I find to be a bit lack-luster, but the twists are great. I am going for my second play-through, on normal this time. Great game. Very dark and not very forgiving. Don't really need to say anything about the awesome art. ^_-</div>

      <div class="apphub_CardTextContent">I don't know where to start on this so I guess i'll just state my conclusion and work back from there:<br>Should you buy this at the current price 24.99(usd), No. Should you buy it if it's on sale at around 75%? Hell yeah!<br>There are many problems i have with this game but there are also some things that were done right that i found as well. Here's list of things I found and you all can be the judge<br><br>Pro's:<br>Pretty cool story, when all is said and done.<br>The whole leading the caravan part of the game, awesome, felt like i was playing the war scenes from a game of thrones<br>All the characters had pretty decent stories and personalities<br>The combat was pretty cool once you got the hang of it. Think tactics ogre mixed in with some wierd type of chess<br>Art fit the feel of the game perfectly<br><br>Con's:<br><br>You obviously set yourself up for a sequel. By this i mean, there are good cliff hangers that leave me thinking &quot;oh, well what are they going to do now?&quot; and then there's  ones that leave me saying &quot;What the ♥♥♥♥ you spent all this ♥♥♥♥ing time mentioning these things that your not even going to tell me about? Seriously? Not even a hint?&quot;; the later of which you did, and i'm kinda upset about that.<br><br>There are bugs still in this I had it crash a couple times on me and the load times for the graphics in the game are pathetic. Borderlands 2 loads quicker than this game does for me. (check out ivrir's story background after that big thing to him happens, btw, it's bugged)<br><br>Game feels rushed half way through, and heres why i say that:<br>You just randomly stop switching between rook and what's his horned face. Just stop. You could've totally split off with him and gone off on his on journey up to the point that he regroups, but you didn't and i was kinda disappointed.<br>You're ending is abrupt, i wasn't quite sure that i hit the end untill the credits popped up.<br>There are 2 GAPING WIDE plot points that never really come to surface, which is too bad becuase I kind of wanted to see more of it.]<br><br>The army combat parts are a little lacking. Honestly, I felt like i  could have led a charge the entire time and been better off.<br>I would have like to actually have command of my armies as well instead of just saying how to engage. A perfect example of how i'd've liked this game to play the army scenes would be Suikoden. Do some like that with your army combat.<br><br>In conclusion(again), Don't buy this game unless its on sale or the cost has gone down to around 10-15$ and you'll be much much happier. Took me about 14 hours to complete and i was a terrible leader who told every one to do what they want, which i'm sure divertered most combat situations, so i could see this game lasting at most 20 hrs on the first play through.</div>
